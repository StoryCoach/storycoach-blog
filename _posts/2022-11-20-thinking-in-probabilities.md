Decision making is all about thinking in probabilities. An outcome of a decision can be binary: left or right. However, when you are “deciding” the answer, you are choosing the one that is most probably the correct one.

I was reminded of this in a [recent blog post by Morgan Housel](https://collabfund.com/blog/a-few-stories-i-like/). I can’t think of a better way to get students practicing the art of thinking in probabilities and be better prepared for the real world.
