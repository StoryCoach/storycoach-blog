A few months ago, I learned about [the Gambler’s Ruin Problem from a career decision story about computer hacker George Hotz](https://rutuldave.com/decision-ninja-blog/gamblers-ruin-problem/). 

A recent Twitter thread by [10-K Diver](https://twitter.com/10kdiver), an absolute cracker of an account to follow on Twitter, has a great in-depth explanation of Gambler’s Ruin with some key takeaways that would benefit decision making in many different contexts. 

Worth a read/like/bookmark:
