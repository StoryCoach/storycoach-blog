If you have ever wondered why the Chief Executive Officer of a company who works fewer hours than many of the employees in the company makes 3X more than anyone else, there is a simple reason why.

In any profession, the value of your skills (e.g compensation) is directly correlated with the impact of decisions you make. Here is tweet that I recently saw that captures this in under 280 characters:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The further along you get in your career, the less you’re paid to actually do things, and the more you’re paid to make great decisions.</p>&mdash; AriannaSimpson.eth (@AriannaSimpson) <a href="https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/1479465925548118016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There are only two things that determine how your life turns out: **luck and the quality of your decisions**.

Luck, by definition, is out of your control. But you can control the quality of your decisions.

This blog is my running journal cataloging tools, tips, and tricks I come across to improve the quality of my decision making. Follow along and expand your tool kit of decision support tools and understand which tools work best for which decisions.
