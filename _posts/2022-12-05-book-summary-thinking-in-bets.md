In the book [Thinking in Bets](https://amzn.to/3Vy3hqJ){:target="_blank"}, Annie Duke explores the concept of decision-making and how our thinking can often be flawed. Duke argues that we often think in terms of absolutes, viewing the world in black and white, but in reality, most situations are more nuanced and complex.

To make better decisions, Duke suggests that we should start thinking in terms of probabilities, or "bets". Rather than trying to determine the absolute truth of a situation, we should consider the potential outcomes and the likelihood of each one. By doing so, we can make more informed decisions that take into account the uncertainty of the world around us.

One of the key ideas in the book is that our emotions can often cloud our judgment, leading us to make decisions that may not be in our best interest. Duke suggests that we should try to separate our emotions from our decision-making process, and instead focus on the facts and the potential outcomes of each decision.

Another important concept that Duke discusses is the role of feedback in decision-making. She argues that in order to improve our decision-making skills, we need to learn from our mistakes and use that feedback to inform our future choices. This means being willing to admit when we are wrong and using that information to make better decisions in the future.

Overall, Thinking in Bets is a thought-provoking book that offers valuable insights into the process of decision-making. By examining the role of emotions, feedback, and probability in our thinking, Duke provides a framework for making more informed and effective decisions.
