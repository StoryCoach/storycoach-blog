In our daily lives, "money" decisions are most frequent. I was recently reminded of one of the best "rules" to keep in mind when making money decisions. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The best investment advice<br><br>h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@milesdeutscher</a> <a href="https://t.co/EXgRkhxf5Y">pic.twitter.com/EXgRkhxf5Y</a></p>&mdash; Romeen Sheth (@RomeenSheth) <a href="https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1596415913892667393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Essentially, when faced with making a "money" decision, ask yourself if you are making a decision to protect your money or making a decision to make more money. If the former, act more quickly, and if the decision is for the latter, act slowly. 

This simple rule will help you make sure you are not making a rash decision too quickly, or on the flip side, taking too long for something that is a low-risk decision.
