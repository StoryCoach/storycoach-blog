The strongest factors working against us in our effort to make better decisions are our [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases){:target="_blank"}. The most common bias which amplifies our tendencies to look for, evaluate, and remember only the information that confirms our preconceptions is [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Confirmation_bias){:target="_blank"}.

Early this year, a word game called [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html){:target="_blank"} captured the attention of many of us who primarily interface with the world using digital devices and nerd out on word games.

To attract the eyeballs of this Wordle-obsessed audience to their website, The New York Times acquired the game and hosted it on their site. What followed from a large group of Wordle players is a perfect study in the impact of confirmation bias in how we interpret whatâ€™s happening even as we experience it in real time.

This thread on Twitter is a worth a read:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This whole &quot;the NYT ruined Wordle!&quot; thing is a great case study in confirmation bias. It also gives us some insight into human nature that helps explain how conspiracy theories work.</p>&mdash; Matthew Shallenberger (@mjshally) <a href="https://twitter.com/mjshally/status/1495458810177245184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
